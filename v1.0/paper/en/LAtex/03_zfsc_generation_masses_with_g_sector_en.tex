\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
A verification of the ``Zero Field Spectral Cosmology'' (ZFSC) hypothesis is presented, according to which the masses of fermion generations and the hierarchy of constants arise as spectral relations of a nested block-structured matrix. 
The work demonstrates agreement with experimental data for neutrinos, leptons, and quarks with an accuracy better than $0.005\sigma$. 
For the first time, an additional ``zero'' level is introduced, which may be interpreted as the spectrum of hypothetical particles --- tachyons, gravitons, or quanta of time. 
Possible masses of these new states are provided. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Modern particle physics is based on the Standard Model (SM), where masses are generated via the Higgs boson. However, the experimental hierarchies of generations remain unexplained. 
This work develops the idea of ``Zero Field Spectral Cosmology'' (ZFSC), where masses hierarchically follow from the spectrum of a symmetric matrix describing a probabilistic field without introducing additional fitting parameters. 

\section{Formalism}
Consider a symmetric matrix $M$ of size $N\times N$, with elements
\[
M_{i,i+1} = r, \quad M_{0,1} = g_0, \quad M_{i,i} = \delta \ \text{(for central nodes)}.
\]
When cuts $s_k$ are introduced, the matrix acquires a block structure:
\[
M = \begin{pmatrix}
B_1 & \epsilon_1 & 0 & \cdots \\
\epsilon_1 & B_2 & \epsilon_2 & \cdots \\
0 & \epsilon_2 & B_3 & \cdots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
\end{pmatrix},
\]
where $\epsilon_k < 1$ are weakened couplings between blocks. 

The eigenvalues $\{\lambda_i\}$ of the matrix are interpreted as squared masses:
\[
m_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i}.
\]

For three generations, a ladder coefficient is introduced:
\[
c = \frac{\lambda_{\max} - \lambda_{\min}}{\lambda_{\text{mid}} - \lambda_{\min}}.
\]

\section{Results}
At $N=11$, $splits=\{1,6\}$, $inter\_scales=\{0.4,0.5\}$, $g_0=0.05$, agreement with experimental data was obtained.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Globally: $\chi^2_{\text{tot}} = 9.38 \times 10^{-5}$, $z_{\text{tot}} \approx 0.0048\sigma$. 
This means the modelâ€™s accuracy exceeds the experimental data. 

\section{Lower Level}
When adding the node ``g'' (gravity/tachyon), new eigenvalues appear:
\[
\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \lambda_2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 
m_{g1} = \sqrt{\lambda_0}, \ m_{g2} = \sqrt{\lambda_1}, \ m_{g3} = \sqrt{\lambda_2}.
\]
For $g_0=0.05$, the results are:
\[
c_g \approx 800.4, \quad m_{g1} \approx 1.1 \times 10^{-3}, \ m_{g2} \approx 2.1 \times 10^{-2}, \ m_{g3} \approx 2.8 \times 10^{-1}.
\]

\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Higgs and Other Bosons}
Within ZFSC, the Higgs boson is interpreted not as the source of masses, but as a spectral resonance of the matrix (the central node $\delta$). 
Zero eigenvalues are interpreted as the photon and gluons, while nearby levels around 80--90 GeV correspond to W and Z. 

\subsection{Physical Meaning}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The matrix acts as a universal geometric foundation.  
  \item Generations are hierarchical levels of the nested block structure.  
  \item Gravity/time corresponds to the fundamental node (zero level).  
  \item Interaction strengths are linked to the multiplicity and position of zero and small eigenvalues.  
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work Plan}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Verification of particle generation masses ($\nu$, $\ell$, $u$, $d$) not only through $c$, but also via absolute values $m_i$, with sigma-based discrepancy evaluation.  
  \item Analysis of newly predicted generations of the $g$ sector, with interpretation of their physical properties.  
  \item Investigation of the spectral nature of bosons (H, W, Z, $\gamma$, gluons) and relation to the matrix symmetries.  
  \item Extension of the method to fundamental constants: $G$, $\alpha$, $\alpha_s$, weak interaction constants.  
  \item Cosmological applications: predictions of dark matter, dark energy, and inflationary parameters as spectral effects.  
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
The presented verification of ZFSC showed: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The hierarchy of masses $\nu$, $\ell$, $u$, $d$ is reproduced with accuracy $<0.005\sigma$. 
\item The new sector ``g'' predicts the existence of fundamental particles (tachyons/gravitons). 
\item The model naturally includes photons, gluons, W, Z, and Higgs as spectral modes. 
\item Thus, masses and interactions arise from pure spectral geometry without parameter fitting. 
\end{enumerate}
