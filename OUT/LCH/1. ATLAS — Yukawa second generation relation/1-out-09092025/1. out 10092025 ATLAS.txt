Note on a possible Yukawa relation in Higgs measurements

Dear ATLAS Higgs Working Group,

While reviewing Higgs Yukawa coupling results, I noticed a simple empirical relation that may be testable with Run-3 data:

δy_μ / y_μ ≈ δy_c / y_c

This suggests that relative deviations of muon and charm Yukawas could be correlated in magnitude and sign. Since ATLAS is uniquely sensitive to both H→μμ and H→cc̄, this relation might be directly testable in future analyses.

Please find attached a short one-page note with details.
