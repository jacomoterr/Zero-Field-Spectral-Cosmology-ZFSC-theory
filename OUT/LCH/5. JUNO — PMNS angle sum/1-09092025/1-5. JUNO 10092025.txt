Note on a possible Yukawa relation in Higgs measurements

Note on a simple empirical PMNS relation

Dear JUNO Collaboration,

I would like to share a simple empirical relation among PMNS mixing angles:

sin^2(2θ_12) + sin^2(2θ_23) ≈ 1.

With JUNO’s high precision on θ_12, combined with global data on θ_23, this relation could be tested with current or near-future results. If confirmed, it would suggest a hidden structural constraint in the lepton sector.

Please find attached a short note.

Sincerely,
