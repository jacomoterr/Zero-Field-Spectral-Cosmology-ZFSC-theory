\noindent
Consider the relation between CP asymmetries in baryon and meson decays:

\[
A_{CP}(\Lambda_b\to pK\pi) - A_{CP}(B^0\to K^+\pi^-) \;\approx\; \kappa \cdot a_{\text{dir}}^{(c)},
\]

where $a_{\text{dir}}^{(c)}$ is the averaged direct CP asymmetry in the charm sector and $\kappa$ is an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant.

\textbf{How it can be tested:}  
LHCb has world-leading precision in both baryonic $b$ decays and charm CP asymmetries. By analyzing correlations between measured $A_{CP}$ values across sectors, one can search for a linear link.

\textbf{Why it may be important:}  
Discovery of such a cross-sector correlation would point to a deeper symmetry or mechanism behind CP violation.
