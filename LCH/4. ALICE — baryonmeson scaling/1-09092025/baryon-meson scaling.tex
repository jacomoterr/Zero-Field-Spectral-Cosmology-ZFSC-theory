\title{Note on a Scaling Relation for ALICE Charm Baryons}

\maketitle

\noindent
A possible scaling relation between baryon/meson yields and elliptic flow is:

\[
v_2(\Lambda_c) - v_2(D^0) \;\propto\; \log\!\left(\frac{\Lambda_c}{D^0}\right).
\]

\textbf{How it can be tested:}  
ALICE has measured both $\Lambda_c/D^0$ ratios and elliptic flows $v_2$ for charm hadrons in Pbâ€“Pb collisions. Correlating the baryon/meson yield ratio with the flow difference could confirm or refute the logarithmic scaling.

\textbf{Why it may be important:}  
Such a relation, if observed, may reveal a hidden universality in hadronization dynamics of charm quarks in the QGP.
